   <summary><h2>Install Instructions</h2></summary>
   <p>
      Most BATTLETECH mods requires BTML and ModTek. This mod is no exception.
      The <a href="https://github.com/Mpstark/ModTek/wiki">ModTek wiki</a> may have more up-to-date <a href="https://github.com/Mpstark/ModTek/wiki/The-Drop-Dead-Simple-Guide-to-Installing-BTML-&-ModTek-&-ModTek-mods">install instructions</a>.
   </p>
   <details>
      <summary><h3>Step 1: Find Game Folder </h3></summary>
      <ol>
         <li> Open File Explorer. Click "This PC" on the left. In the top right corner it should says "Search This PC".
         <li> Click on it and type "BATTLETECH", without the quote. Your PC may take a while to do the search.
         <li> If you get one result, that is the game folder.
         <li> If you get multiple results, right click each one and "Open in new window". This will keep the search result untouched.
         <li> The one that has a "BattleTech_Data" folder is your game folder. You should also see the BattleTech icon and BattleTechLauncher icon.
      </ol>
   </details>
   <details>
      <summary><h3>Step 2: Install BTML</h3></summary>
      <ol>
         <li> Download and Extract <a href="https://github.com/Mpstark/BattleTechModLoader/releases
         ">BTML</a>. You should see three files - two dll and one exe.
         <li> Find the BATTLETECH\BattleTech_Data\Managed folder (where BATTLETECH is your game folder.)</li>
         <li> The correct folder should have lots of file. One of them should be "Assembly-CSharp.dll". If you don't see this file you're in the wrong folder.
         <li> Copy all three files to it. Then run "BattleTechModLoaderInjector". Say yes if it ask whether to overwrite.
         <li> It should says "Injection complete!" or "Assembly-CSharp.dll already injected".
         <li> The Injector need to be run once after every game update.  If all your mods suddenly stop working, this is normally what happened.
      </ol>
   </details>
   <details>
      <summary><h3>Step 3: Install ModTek</h3></summary>
      <ol>
         <li> Download <a href="https://github.com/Mpstark/ModTek/releases">ModTek.dll</a>
         <li> Create a "Mods" folder in the game folder (Right click in the folder, New > Folder) and put the dll in it
         <li> Launch the Game. At the bottom of main menu there is a version string. Part of it should be "W/ MODTEK".
      </ol>
   </details>
   <details open>
      <summary><h3>Step 4: Install this mod</h3></summary>
      <ol>
         <li> Download and extact this mod to the Mods folder of the game.
         <li> i.e. BATTLETECH\Mods\AttackImprovementMod\ should contains "mod.json", "AttackImprovementMod.dll", and other files and folders
         <li> Exit and Re-launch the game and the mod should be loaded.  If it doesn't, BTModLoader.log will log why.
         <li> This mod also keeps its own log of what it can or cannot try to modify in the mod folder.

   <summary><h2>Features</h2></summary>
   <p>
      The defaul options aim to fix and tune the game to a similar balance level with the vanilla game,
      make the numbers you see closer to the actual numbers, without overwhelming you.
      Not all features are enabled by default.
   </p>
   <p>
      Each feature can be individually enabled, disabled, or sometimes adjusted.
      Disabled features will not load and will cause no overhead.
   </p>
   <p>
      The mod is developed and tested on BATTLETECH v1.1 (Beta).
      Some features may not work or may work incorrectly in other game versions.
      All features apply equally to player and AI, to campaign and skirmish.
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>Enable Vehicle Called Shot</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>FixVehicleCalledShot</code> (true/false, default true)<br>
         <p>Called shot have absolutely no effect on vehicles, probably because there isn't enough time to implement it.
         <p>In the code, Mech Locations and Vehicle Locations are two separate data type, meaning there are two set of states and methods to handle hit location.
         And vehicle's called shot handling is incomplete. You can pick a called shot location, but it never reach the hit location routine.
         This can be verified by disabling this setting and enabling attack log (below).
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>Precise Hit Location Distribution</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>FixHitDistribution</code> (true/false, default true)<br>
         <p>Game version 1.1 introduced degrading called shot effect for SRM and MG,
         but because the code that determine hit distribution is not designed for fraction called shot weight,
         the actual distribution is slightly bugged.
         <p>This mod can replace the hit distribution routine with an improved version that has better precision.
         On game version 1.1.0 and before, this would also fix the bug that cause abnormally high head hit chances.
         <hr>
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>Enable Clustering Called Shot</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>CalledShotUseClustering</code> (true/false, default true)<br>
         <p>When enabled, called shot has a higher chance to hit adjacent locations.
         For example, head called shot would bias the head, but also the three torsos to a lesser degree.
         <p>This is the default behaviour before game version 1.0.4,
         which caused very low called head shot chances because head is normally excluded from clustering.
         In fact, called shot actually had a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/637090/discussions/0/1697176044370891096/">lower chance</a>
         to hit the head than blind shots.
         <p>This mod was intended to fix it, but 1.1 came out first.
         So this mod now restores the clustering effect, instead of fixing the head called shot bug.
         Clustering strength can be modified in <code>constants\CombatGameConstants.json</code>
         <p>Note that this does not apply to Vehicle called shot;
         the default vehicle clustering is a real mess, and even when fixed there are too few locations to cluster.
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>Adjust Called Shot Effect vs Mech</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>MechCalledShotMultiplier</code> (0 to any small number, default 0.33)<br>
         <p>When clustering called shot is enabled, chance to hit called locations will be amplified by clustering weight.
         At original strength, this can cause head hit chance is up to 40%.
         <p>This setting let you tune called shot's weight multipliers.
         Default is 0.33 to counter the effect of CalledShotClusterStrength.
         Set to 1.0 would retain original multiplier, while 0.0 will removing it leaving only clustering effect (if enabled).
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>Adjust Called Shot Effect vs Mech</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>VehicleCalledShotMultiplier</code> (0 to any small number, default 0.75)<br>
         <p>Called shot didn't work on vehicles without modding.
         Once that is fixed, unmodified called shot is pretty powerful on vehicles because of its low number of locations.
         This setting tries to balance that.
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>Fix Called Shot Popup</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>ShowRealMechCalledShotChance</code> (true/false, default true)<br>
         <p>Setting: <code>ShowRealVehicleCalledShotChance</code> (true/false, default true)<br>
         <p>When enabled, the popups will reflect modded hit distribution.
         Also, if vehicle called shot fix is disabled, vehicle called shot chance will be updated to reflect disabled called shot.
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>(Advanced) Show Hit Distribution in Decimal</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>ShowDecimalCalledChance</code> (true/false, default false)<br>
         <p>When enabled, called shot popup will show all percentages to one decimal point.
         This option affects <i>only</i> fixed popups (above), since the rendering is not separated from display.
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>Adjust Roll "Correction"</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>RollCorrectionStrength</code> (0 to 2, default 0.5)<br>
         <p>It is no secret that the game fudge all hit rolls, called a "correction".
         As a result, real hit chances are shifted away from 50%,
         for example 75% becomes 84% while 25% becomes 16%.
         This can create a rift between what you see and what you get,
         especially on low chance shots.
         <p>This mod does not aim to completely disable roll adjustment, and thus default to half its strength.
         You can set the strength to zero to disable it, 1 to use original formula, 2 to amplify it, or any value in between.
         See compatibility section (below) for the formula.
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>(Advanced) Adjust Miss Streak Threshold</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>MissStreakBreakerThreshold</code> (0 to 1, default 0.5)<br>
         <p>In addition to roll adjustment, the game also has a "miss streak breaker".
         Whenever you miss an attack of which hit chance &gt; 50%,
         the streak breaker will kicks in and adjust your hit chance up after and on top of roll adjustment.
         The bonus accumulates until you land a hit (regards of hit chance), at which point it resets to 0.
         <p>This setting let you adjust the threshold.
         0.75 means it applies to attack of which hit chance &gt; 75%, or 80% and up in other words.
         Set to 0 enable it for all attack, or set to 1 to effectively disable it.
         Default is 0.5 which is the game's default.
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>(Advanced) Adjust Miss Streak Bonus</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>MissStreakBreakerDivider</code> (-100 to any small number, default 5)<br>
         <p>For every miss that crosses the threshold, the threshold is deduced from hit chance, then divided by 5.
         The result is then added as streak breaker bonus.
         <p>Set this setting to a positive number to override the divider.  For example at threshold 0.5 and divider 3,
         a 95% miss result in (95%-0.5)/3 = 15% bonus to subsequence shots until hit.
         Default is 5 which is the game's default.
         <p>Set this setting to zero or negative integer to replace it with a constant value.
         For example -5 means each triggering miss adds 5% bonus, and -100 will make sure the next shot always hit.
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>(Advanced) Show Real Hit Chance</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>ShowRealWeaponHitChance</code> (true/false, default false)<br>
         <p>It's one thing to fudge the rolls.  It is another to let you know.
         Enabling this would let you see the real hit chance in weapon panel.
         (The reverse formula is pretty complicated. But don't worry, the result is cached to not kill your computer!)
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>(Advanced) Show Hit Chance in Decimal</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>ShowDecimalHitChance</code> (true/false, default false)<br>
         <p>When enabled, weapon panel will show hit chances to one decimal point.
         Obviously, it's not very meaningful without showing real hit chances,
         but if you have another mod that modify the hit chance, then this mod <i>may</i> be able to render it in decimal.
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3> Show Heat and Stability numbers </h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>ShowHeatAndStab</code> (true/false, default true)<br>
         <p>When enabled, selection and target panel will show heat and stability damage number,
         below unit class and number of jump jets.
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3> Allow free Melee and DFA positioning </h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>IncreaseMeleePositionChoice</code> (true/false, default true)<br>
         <p>Setting: <code>IncreaseDFAPositionChoice</code> (true/false, default true)<br>
         <p>When enabled, melee and DFA can use all available positions, instead of nearest three.
         <hr>
         <p>Setting: <code>UnlockMeleePositioning</code> (true/false, default true)<br>
         <p>When enabled, free player units from standing still when target is already in melee range.
      </details></li>

      <li> <details>
         <summary><h3>(Advanced) Attack Log</h3></summary>
         <p>Setting: <code>LogHitRolls</code> (true/false, default false)<br>
         <p>When enabled, the mod will keep an attack log in the mod's folder.
         <p>It'll log various attack resolution info such as attacker, attack roll, corrected roll,
         streak breaker, location roll, hit table, and other info.
         The log is cleared every time the game launches and load this mod.
         <p>Because critical roll happens when playing weapon effect,
         rather than when the hit/location rolls are rolled before firing,
         adding critical roll requires an architecture change of this mod's log system.
         <hr>
         <p>Setting: <code>PersistentLog</code> (true/false, default false)<br>
         <p>When enabled, the attack log will not auto-clear on launch.
         <hr>
         <p>Setting: <code>LogFolder</code> (string, default "")<br>
         <p>Set path of log files. Default is empty which will use mod folder.
      </details></li>

   </p>
   <p>
      If you know programming, you can follow these steps to see game code and where to learn how BATTLETECH mod works:
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li> Install <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
      ">Visual Studio</a>, or VS. This mod is developed with VS 2017 Community Edition. You'll need the ".NET desktop development" workload.
      <li> Down and Run <a href="https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/releases">DnSpy</a>
      <li> Download DnSpy's Unity x64 debugging zip, extract 5.6.5/mono.dll, and replace the game's one.
      <li> Create an Environment Variable "DNSPY_UNITY_DBG" with the value "--debugger-agent=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=127.0.0.1:55555,defer=y" (both without the quotes). This will instruct the modified game to connect to DnSpy.
      <li> Run the game. If you want you can <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/tcpview">check that</a> its port 55555 is opened.
      <li> Launch the modified BATTLETECH game.
      <li> In DnSpy, click the Start button on toolbar, or the "Start Debugging" menu item. This will popup a dialogue. Select "Unity (Connect)" and leave other settings at default.
      <li> DnSpy should now be connected to the game and the stats says "Running...".
      <li> Go to Debug > Windows > Modules, double click "Assembly-CSharp.dll".  This will load the assembly.  It contains most BATTLETECH code.
      <li> You may now search and browse the assembly!  For example in the search tab you can type "GetCorrectedRoll" to find the method. Clicking on it will show you the roll correction code.
      <li> Right click on method name (or any identifier) and click "Analyse".  It'll help you find where and how the method is called, or its override hierarchy.
      <li> Left click the assembly, then File > Export to Project. This will decompile all code which you can browse with other editor or IDE.
      <li> Head to the <a href="https://github.com/Mpstark/ModTek/wiki">ModTek wiki</a> to learn how to make a mod.  For a code mode like this one, you need <a href="https://github.com/Mpstark/ModTek/wiki/The-mod.json-Format">"mod.json"</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Mpstark/ModTek/wiki/Writing-ModTek-DLL-mods">dll</a>.
      <li> You may notice that this patch manually calls Harmony to patch things, instead of using Annotation. This gives me much better control such as sharing of patch methods. You may read <a href="https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/wiki">Harmony wiki</a> to learn how it works.
